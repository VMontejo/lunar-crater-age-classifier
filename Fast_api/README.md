# 🛠️ Running the API Locally
The prediction service is run using Uvicorn on the `Fast_api.app:app` module path.

## 1. Ensure dependencies
The `requirements.txt` is updated with `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `tensorflow`, and `pillow`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Run the Server
Execute the following command from the project root (`lunar-crater-age-classifier`):

```bash
# The '--reload' flag enables auto-restart during development
uvicorn Fast_api.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

## 3. How to test the endpoints
The easiest way to test a file upload endpoint is via the Swagger UI generated by FastAPI.
Open your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and use the /predict form to upload
a sample image.

Alternatively, you can simply run:

```bash
# Just run the API
make run-api

# Just open the docs (if API is already running)
make open-docs

# Both: start API AND open docs in browser
make api
```
